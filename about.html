        “It doesn’t matter where you’re from, who you choose to be, what age you
        are; it doesn’t matter,” says Bang Chan, leader of Stray Kids, to
        deafening cheers from an adoring Los Angeles concert crowd. “If you’re
        here, you’re all Stays.”

        It’s a sentiment that encapsulates Stray Kids’ core message: to
        represent — and make music for — the outcasts, misfits, and those who
        stray from the expected path. This message seems to have resonated
        deeply with their fanbase, named STAY, who earlier this year helped
        rocket the group to their first No.1 on the Billboard 200 album chart.
        Stray Kids sold over 110,000 units of their 2022 mini-album ‘ODDINARY’
        in the first week in the US alone, with around 100,000 of those
        accounted for by physical album sales. The octet achieved impressive
        digital streaming numbers too, with the 7-track mini-album gaining 8.9
        million streams on Spotify just one day after its release. They also
        recently completed a whirlwind North American arena tour, selling out
        venues across the country with a projected profit of more than $16
        million for 10 reported shows.Even as the accolades pour in, Stray Kids
        remain humble and aware of their unique position in the public eye.
        Their journey has been anything but easy; formed in 2017 during an
        eponymously named televised survival show, the group represented an
        unprecedented (and risky) attempt by JYP Entertainment, one of South
        Korea’s flagship agencies, to change the K-pop game. Their versatility
        and willingness to experiment is a huge asset, but it’s not the only
        thing that sets them apart. With 3Racha being credited as primary
        producers for nearly every track in their discography (and the other
        members contributing in recent releases), Stray Kids’ music is the most
        authentic representation of their identity as artists. As Changbin
        astutely states in the album introduction for ‘ODDINARY’ — “The music
        style of Stray Kids is a bit niche. I don’t think it’s popular music…
        but we would like to express our style (through this album). Every
        generation prefers a different genre. We want to approach people with
        music that can become a (new) standard.”

        This youthful mix of ambition and accessibility has struck a chord with
        Stays around the world. For fans of all ages and backgrounds struggling
        with identity and self-perception in a world crippled by pandemics,
        socio-economic crises, and online negativity, Stray Kids’ message of
        unabashed self-confidence and open emotional expression is a beacon of
        hope. The members themselves take every available chance to interact
        with fans through various social media platforms, share personal
        stories, advice, and heartfelt declarations of love and support. Bang
        Chan is famous for his weekly live broadcasts on the Vlive app, which
        garner millions of views and, according to fans, are a source of great
        comfort to anyone going through a tough time. Felix and Lee Know are
        frequent users of the text-based app Bubble, where they share everything
        from positive affirmations to food recommendations. Hyunjin and I.N post
        frequently on the group’s Instagram page (which, at the time of writing,
        has 22.6 million followers), sharing their passions for photography and
        art (Hyunjin) and fashion (I.N). Seungmin likes to broadcast his vocal
        practices, Changbin films mini-vlogs during his down time, and Han is
        known for his taste in anime and movies, which he freely shares with
        fans. Stray Kids are also known to give Stays a glimpse into their
        individual personalities and group camaraderie through various kinds of
        online content (see: their YouTube series, 2 Kids Room). This emphasis
        on building a solid relationship between fan and artist is one of the
        factors that has made K-pop such an unstoppable force in fandom culture.
        It allows idols to bridge the gap between ‘creators’ and ‘consumers’ and
        foster a tight-knit sense of community amongst fans. Stray Kids are
        disarmingly honest, down-to-earth, and relatable, and have continued to
        make sincere efforts to connect with their fans across the globe.
